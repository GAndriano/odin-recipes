        <img src="../recipes/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">
        <p>Pizza is one of the world's most reknowned foods. While created in Italy, America has adopted it into its' own cultural staple. It is a delicious combination of bread, cheese, and tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bag pizza dough</li>
            <li>16 oz pizza sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp pecorino romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 roll of unsalted mozzarella, sliced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp basil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Let dough rise by leaving it out on a counter for 30 mins.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Stretch the dough. Place pre-made dough on top of flour. Stretch the dough by pinching the outside in a circular motion to spread it out. Then alternate between pinching and pulling the dough from underneath with knuckles in an outward motion. When it's large enough, transfer it to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and al ight drizzle of olive oil.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Bake the dough in the oven at 450 for 7 minutes.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Once the dough is cooked, take it out and preheat the oven to 500. Brush olive oil around the permieter of the dough to create a golden crust. Add the sauce, cheeses, and basil.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Bake the pizza at 500 for 7-10 minutes, removing when the mozzarella cheese has melted. Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
